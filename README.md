# Getting Started with Go

## Overview

Welcome to the "Getting Started with Go" course review! This repository contains my solutions for graded module activities in each week of the course.

## Week-wise Activities

### Week 1: Getting Started with Go

- **Module 1 Activity:** "Hello, world!"

    Week 1 serves as an introduction to Go, covering the basics and advantages of using the language. The module explores the features of Go and guides me through the installation of the programming environment on my computer. The week concludes with me writing a simple program that displays "Hello, World" on my screen.

### Week 2: Basic Data Types

- **Module 2 Activity:** `trunc.go`
- **Module 2 Activity:** `findian.go`

    In Week 2, I delved into basic data types in Go, providing myself an opportunity to practice writing routines that manipulate different data objects, including floating-point numbers and strings.

### Week 3: Composite Data Types

- **Module 3 Activity:** `slice.go`

    In Week 3, I explored more complex data types, including arrays, slices, maps, and structs. This module provided me with a chance to practice writing code that makes use of these composite data types.

### Week 4: Protocols and Formats

- **Module 4 Activity:** `makejson.go`
- **Final Course Activity:** `read.go`

    The final week introduced remote function calls (RFCs) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) in Go. I learned how to access and manipulate data from external files, gaining hands-on experience in writing routines using Go that exercise this functionality.
